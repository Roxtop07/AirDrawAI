# AirDraw AI â€“ Gesture-Based Smart Drawing & AI Analysis ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤–
**Overview**

AirDraw AI is an innovative, touch-free digital drawing system that allows users to draw, erase, and interact with a virtual canvas using only hand gestures. It integrates real-time hand tracking, AI-powered analysis, and dynamic tool selection, providing a seamless and intuitive drawing experience.

**Key Features**

âœ… Gesture-Based Drawing â€“ Use hand movements to draw, erase, and interact without touching a screen.

âœ… AI-Powered Interpretation â€“ Send sketches to Gemini AI for text recognition, problem-solving, and image analysis.

âœ… Dynamic Color & Brush Selection â€“ Select colors and brush sizes using gestures.

âœ… Canvas Reset â€“ Clear the canvas instantly using a dedicated gesture.

âœ… On-Screen AI Response â€“ AI-generated insights and responses appear directly on the canvas.

âœ… Real-Time Processing â€“ Optimized for high FPS and smooth, lag-free webcam input.

âœ… Intuitive UI Overlays â€“ Interactive color wheel and brush size selector for an enhanced drawing experience.

**How It Works**

Hand Tracking â€“ Uses OpenCV and cvzoneâ€™s HandTrackingModule to detect hand and finger positions.

Gesture Recognition â€“ Identifies specific hand gestures to trigger drawing, erasing, brush selection, and canvas clearing.

AI Integration â€“ Captures and processes drawn images using Gemini AI for recognition and analysis.

Dynamic Tool Selection â€“ Hand gestures allow users to switch brushes, change colors, and modify brush sizes.

On-Screen Output â€“ AI-generated responses are directly displayed on the canvas, providing instant feedback.
